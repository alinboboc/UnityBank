## Final toughts

- Even this is a  simple Java project, this is the first one that I create with this technology that is new to me. By finishing this project, I can say that I am more confident in writing Java code and I start understanding actual code not only HTML and CSS.
- I know that this project can be alot improved but I want to kepp it this way, to see from where I start and to remind me that even if I think my code is amazing, the experience will prove it to be crap.
- I want to thank to everybody that was a part in my journey at IT School starting with soleil that is a young guy with a hudge potencial in teaching people difficult stuff and to my colleagues that always improved themselves and made me work extra hours to catch them.
